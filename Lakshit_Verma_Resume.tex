\begin{rSubsection}{\bf Student Software Developer, Dhwani RIS}{\em May 2025 -- August 2025}{\href{https://codeforgovtech.in/dedicated_mentoring_program/}{Code for GovTech DMP}}{Remote}
\item Designed and implemented a FastAPI-based backend parser from scratch enabling bulk conversion of Excel-based survey forms through XLSForm to mForm-compatible JSON, supporting forms with up to 400+ questions per upload.
\item Built an Angular frontend from scratch for real-time asynchronous Excel uploads, live previews, inline error reporting, and batch operations, integrated with REST APIs and MongoDB for seamless form lifecycle management.
\item Achieved batch processing speeds of 2.16 seconds for 9 forms ($\approx$3,600 questions total), with per-question conversion latency averaging 0.15 ms and single-form save times of 240ms.
\item Created comprehensive automated testing scripts and CI/CD pipelines, validating JSON output against mForm templates and implementing edge-case handling for both frontend and backend.
